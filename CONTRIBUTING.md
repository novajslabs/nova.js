## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any new features**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create [a feature request](https://github.com/dlcastillop/nova.js/discussions/new?category=ideas) to first discuss any new ideas.
